== Introduction

=== Motivation

{trd-website}[{trd}] is an open collection of high quality guidance for solutions that address real-world use cases with featured SUSE, partner, and community components.
Documents are modular and rendered from multiple source files.
These source files are freely available and open source licensed in the {trd-repo}[GitHub repository].


{trd} consists of four types of documents:

* *Getting Started Guide*
//
+
Solution introduction with step-by-step guidance for installation and configuration.

* *Reference Implementation*
//
+
Introductory architectural approach and basis for deployment of solution with the SUSE portfolio.

* *Reference Configuration*
//
+
Reference Implementation with specified partner hardware and software components.

* *Enterprise Architecture*
//
+
Architectural overview of solution from an enterprise landscape perspective.


Community engagement with {trd} is encouraged.
You can easily submit quick fixes and even section updates through _Report an issue_ links in the HTML version of any document.
For longer fixes and new documents, you should reference the {trd-guide}[{title}] to familiar with the style, tools, and workflows of a successful contributor.



=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide outlines style, tools, and workflows for successful contributions to {trd}.



=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for architects, developers, engineers, and technical writers.



== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify any prerequisites the reader would need
// in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.

Contributors to {trd} need the following:

* A plain text editor
+
[NOTE]
====
Your editor should save files encoded to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8] and end lines only with the line feed character.

See also {git-line-endings-website}[Configuring Git to handle line endings].
====

* {github-website}[GitHub] account and basic Git skills

* Basic understanding of the {asciidoc-website}[AsciiDoc] markup language
//
+
See <<AsciiDoc>>.

* DAPS toolchain (for rendering documents)
//
+
--
You have two options:

* {daps-install-website}[Install DAPS] and its dependencies directly, including the latest {suse-xsl-website}[SUSE XSL Stylesheets].

* Use the {daps2docker-website}[DAPS2Docker] container implementation.
--
+
See <<DAPS>> for more information.

* PDF viewer and Web browser (for reviewing rendered documents)

== Repository structure

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Describe the general file and directory structure
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

{trd} is both a {trd-website}[documentation portal] with links to published documentation and a {trd-repo}[GitHub repository] of source files.
As a contributor, you work with source files.
So, you need a general understanding of the structure and contents of the source repository.


The repository's top-level directories are:

* _linux_: contains Linux-focused reference documentation

* _kubernetes_: contains Kubernetes-focused reference documentation

* _common_: contains ancillary and shared files, templates, scripts, and so on

* _contributors_: contains this guide for contributors

[listing]
----
├── common
├── contributors
├── kubernetes
│   ├── enterprise
│   ├── reference
│   └── start
└── linux
    ├── enterprise
    ├── reference
    └── start
----


The _linux_ and _kubernetes_ directories are further subdivided by document type:

* _start_: getting started guides

* _reference_: reference implementations and reference configurations

* _enterprise_: enterprise architectures


[NOTE]
====
The distinction between Linux- and Kubernetes-focused reference documentation may become deprecated, and the contents merged.

=== Reference Implementation and Reference Configuration structure

== Templates and framework

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Your {trd} documentation project relies on different types of source files, placed in specific locations within the repository's directory structure.
The files and structures can be created from scratch.
But you can use the provided automation tools to generate a framework for you, including templates for your source files.
