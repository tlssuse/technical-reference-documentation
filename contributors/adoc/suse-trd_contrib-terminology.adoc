Branch::
A branch represents an independent line of development.
It allows you to make edits and commits without affecting the primary or 'main' branch of repository.
Your branch must be merged into the 'main' branch of the _upstream_ repository to be published.

Clone::
A clone is a copy of a repository, typically hosted on your local system.

Commit::
A commit represents a specific revision or version in your project's Git history.

Fork::
A fork is a copy of a repository.
When you fork a repository, you create a copy in which you can safely make changes without affecting the original project.
For this guide, your fork of {trd} is hosted in your GitHub account.

Git::
{git-website}[Git] is a free and open source, distributed version control system.

GitHub::
{github-website}[GitHub] is a developer platform and service powered by Git and used by millions of developers to build, scale, and deliver secure software.
{trd} is hosted on GitHub to ease collaboration and contributions from the global community.

Pull request::
A pull request is submission to a repository's collaborators to accept your proposed changes.
In the {trd} workflow, you create a branch, make all your changes in this branch, then create a pull request to the _upstream_ repository.
Once your pull request is accepted, it is merged into the _upstream_ 'main' branch.

Remote::
A remote is a repository that is used to track a project but resides somewhere else.
For the workflow outlined in this guide, you have two remotes:
+
* your fork of the {trd} repository on GitHub, referred to by the name, _origin_.
* the {trd} repository on GitHub, referred to by _upstream_.

Repository::
A repository is a data structure containing files, directories, and metadata about the project (such as commit history, tags, branches, authors, and more).
The {trd} repository hosted on GitHub contains the source files for the published documents, history of changes in those documents, and more.
